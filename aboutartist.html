    <p id="paragraph"  > Hi!

        I am Sara Richtmyer, a graphic design student at The College of New Jersey. For as long as I can remember, I have always been creative and created artwork.
        
        Throughout high school and college, I have experimented with a variety of artistic mediums including Procreate, alcohol-based markers, colored pencils, acrylic paints, watercolors, and photography. During my studies at TCNJ, I have also learned how to use Adobe software such as Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and Premiere Pro. However, I primarily use Procreate.
        
        Most of my work is on fanart, where I love bringing characters from anime, video games, and superhero comics to life. Additionally, I enjoy creating original characters of my own.
        
        Thank you for checking out my artwork!</p>
